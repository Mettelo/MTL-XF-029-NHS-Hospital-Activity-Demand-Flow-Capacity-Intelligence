# MTL-XF-029 — Required deliverables and metric contracts

**Decision:** Which hospital activity streams show sustained change requiring planning investigation, and what capacity, waiting-list and workforce evidence is still needed to diagnose service pressure?  
**Business acceptance:** Director of Hospital Planning & Service Transformation  
**Core scope:** Retain the agreed combined April 2018–March 2026 CSV as the intended input, subject to identity validation. The official March 2026 release separately lists historical 2018/19–2024/25 and 2025/26 M13 MAR CSVs; register these as a two-file fallback if the agreed combined file cannot be validated. Core analysis is at the verified national activity-stream grain. Provider detail and outpatient fields must be confirmed in the acquired MAR schema before inclusion.

All artefact locations refer to the team repository. Deliver the core before optional extensions. [The source register](../data/SOURCE_REGISTER.md) documents evidence status; required field support is a G1 release condition.

## D1 — Discovery & requirements

**Due:** Week 1 · **Location:** `docs/01-discovery/` · **Owner:** Business Analyst

Map the monthly hospital activity planning review, stakeholder needs, current reporting failures and target decision. Eight prioritised requirements must cover the business questions, scope gates and usable outputs.

**Pass evidence:** Each requirement has an accountable user, artefact, test and acceptance owner.

## D2 — Sources, governance & cohort contract

**Due:** Week 2 · **Location:** `data/; docs/02-data-governance/` · **Owner:** Data Governance Analyst

Complete the source-to-deliverable support matrix and classify core, fallback and optional inputs. Retain the agreed combined April 2018–March 2026 CSV as the intended input, subject to identity validation. The official March 2026 release separately lists historical 2018/19–2024/25 and 2025/26 M13 MAR CSVs; register these as a two-file fallback if the agreed combined file cannot be validated. Core analysis is at the verified national activity-stream grain. Provider detail and outpatient fields must be confirmed in the acquired MAR schema before inclusion.

**Pass evidence:** Every used input has provenance, exact version/coverage, licence evidence and SHA-256; conditional scope cannot be signed off without supporting fields.

## D3 — Reproducible model & ingestion

**Due:** Week 3 · **Location:** `src/; sql/; docs/03-data-model/` · **Owner:** Data Engineer

Implement raw preservation, selection, schema checks, curated facts and dimensions. Reporting month × activity stream × published measure × available provider/geography/category × revision status. Spell, episode, admission, attendance and patient measures are distinct. If data is cumulative, derive monthly increments only within the same valid financial-year series.

**Pass evidence:** Zero unexplained duplicate keys or join inflation; every input row accounted for as retained/excluded/quarantined.

## D4 — Quality, source reconciliation & exceptions

**Due:** Week 3 · **Location:** `tests/; docs/04-data-quality/` · **Owner:** Independent reviewer + domain specialist

Execute source, denominator, missingness, boundary and linkage checks against the risk 'Unconfirmed combined-file provenance or cumulative/snapshot handling could invalidate every downstream activity comparison.'

**Pass evidence:** Reconcile five source values from at least two periods or segments; retain source coordinates, precision and explanations for non-additive totals.

## D5 — Governed metric catalogue

**Due:** Week 4 · **Location:** `docs/05-kpi-catalogue/` · **Owner:** Domain specialist + Data Governance Analyst

Implement the 8 metric contracts below; distinguish unconditional core metrics from gated extensions.

**Pass evidence:** Each core metric has purpose, raw fields, formula, grain, denominator/unit, missing/zero handling, owner, refresh and test; conditional items have explicit eligibility or unavailable status.

## D6 — Domain assessment

**Due:** Week 5 · **Location:** `analysis/; docs/06-analysis/` · **Owner:** Domain analyst

Build separate verified elective and non-elective trajectories with source-specific units and reporting status; include outpatient trajectories only when the validated MAR schema supports them or a compatible official extension is registered. Compare recent activity with a declared pre-pandemic and/or recent baseline; identify sustained changes over at least three months.

**Pass evidence:** At least five supported findings answer the five questions or document a genuine evidence gap; each includes magnitude, scope, comparison and limitation.

## D7 — Investigation framework & scenarios

**Due:** Week 6 · **Location:** `docs/07-decision-framework/` · **Owner:** Director of Hospital Planning & Service Transformation (business acceptance)

Compare supported streams using same-month year-on-year changes and a declared baseline index, requiring at least three contiguous comparable monthly flows for persistence. Show a recent baseline and, where valid, a pre-pandemic comparator separately. The investigation list may contain fewer than ten streams and is never padded with invented provider cases.

**Pass evidence:** Publish eligibility, component definitions, scenario differences and up to ten supported cases; every case names a service role, evidence request and review trigger.

## D8 — Decision-support BI

**Due:** Draft Week 6; final Week 7 · **Location:** `dashboard/` · **Owner:** BI Developer

Build overview, diagnostic and quality pages for the monthly hospital activity planning review. Show period, units, definitions, missingness and core/extension status.

**Pass evidence:** Five headline values reconcile; every visible filter and reset tested; accessible static export plus free review/build path.

## D9 — Assurance & simulated UAT

**Due:** Week 7 · **Location:** `docs/08-assurance-uat/` · **Owner:** Independent reviewer

Execute DT1–DT10 below, plus any tool-specific calculations and filter tests. Record expected/actual evidence, requirement links and defects.

**Pass evidence:** All ten mandatory domain cases evidenced; no critical/high issue remains; accepted lower-impact limitations have named review.

## D10 — Technical & operational handover

**Due:** Week 8 · **Location:** `docs/09-technical-handover/` · **Owner:** Data Engineer + a second-member reviewer

Provide environment, immutable manifest, end-to-end run, output checks, troubleshooting and refresh/change process.

**Pass evidence:** A second member regenerates equivalent core outputs without undocumented edits and records checks, environment, duration and result.

## D11 — Executive briefing & presentation

**Due:** Week 8 · **Location:** `deliverables/` · **Owner:** Business Analyst + specialist service roles

Deliver maximum two-page briefing and 15–20 minute presentation to Director of Hospital Planning & Service Transformation: decision, five findings, scenario comparison, investigation actions, evidence gaps and next review.

**Pass evidence:** Every numeric claim links to tested evidence; explicitly show a case where action is not yet supported.

## D12 — Contribution & delivery record

**Due:** Weekly; final Week 8 · **Location:** `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` · **Owner:** Delivery Lead

Link actual authored work, reviews, issues/PRs/commits and presentation/handover contributions for every member.

**Pass evidence:** All responsibilities have owners and evidence; commit count alone is insufficient.

## Metric contracts — authoritative definitions

| Metric | Definition / support condition |
| --- | --- |
| Elective activity | Publisher-defined elective admissions/spells/episodes, labelled precisely with measure. |
| Non-elective activity | Publisher-defined non-elective activity using a separate compatible category. |
| Outpatient activity — conditional extension | Required only when the acquired MAR fields support it or a compatible official extension is registered; label appointments versus attendances. |
| Year-on-year activity change | 100 × (monthly activity / corresponding prior-year month − 1), with positive comparable base. |
| Trailing twelve-month activity | Sum of twelve genuine contiguous monthly flows; never sum year-to-date cumulative values. |
| Activity mix | 100 × compatible activity component / matching stream total; do not divide outpatient attendances by inpatient episodes. |
| Baseline index | 100 × current activity / declared comparable baseline; label pandemic and reporting breaks. |
| Revision/coverage flag | Valid monthly-flow coverage and provisional/snapshot status by verified national stream; provider continuity only for a registered provider extension. |

For each metric add source ID and actual raw fields, business purpose, formula, grain, valid population, unit, numerator/denominator, hierarchy, suppression/zero/missing handling, owner, refresh and test evidence. Verify source rounding before setting a reconciliation tolerance. A conditional item is not silently promoted into core; a core requirement is not silently waived.

## Project-specific outcomes

1. Every required output states its precise activity unit and whether the input is monthly or cumulative.
2. National core results remain usable without provider data or an outpatient extension.
3. Every capacity hypothesis identifies the missing bed, workforce, waiting-list or case-mix evidence.

See [DT1–DT10 and investigation rules](ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md) for worked pass/fail cases. Source schemas, specific period selections and reference versions must be signed at G1. Keep calculation definitions here; other guidance pages link to this contract rather than maintaining competing copies.
